# Phase 10 — validation in progress

Scope: Phase 10 only. Phase 11 has not started. This is an evidence ledger,
not final acceptance. Samsung results below were supplied by the project owner;
Linux/CI checks cannot replace the remaining phone tests.

## Follow-up: owner rejected provider/add-on acceptance

New Samsung screenshots show an app-shell uv/uvx probe ending in exit 127 and
provider cooldown, with no completed dependency installation. #334 therefore
does not establish acceptance for those tasks.

The follow-up fixes route environment-only bash version probes to Termux, add
`dependency_install` (official `pkg install uv`, then actual uv and uvx version
checks), and bootstrap uv before Browser Use/Docling MCP verification. Installing
uv alone never marks either MCP installed. Native Python dependencies may still
reject Android and must return their actual errors.
Persisted conversations also refresh their built-in tool schemas after upgrade;
previously they could retain only the pre-upgrade tools despite the new prompt.

The provider router previously rejected every alternative model sharing Kilo's
base URL. It now discovers zero-price, tools-capable routes from Kilo's real
catalog. Model-specific upstream capacity failures may select another model;
account/gateway rate limits block all sibling models for the cooldown. These are
alternative model backends on the same gateway, not independent gateway services.
An anonymous live API probe returned a real tool call from StepFun 3.7 Flash.
Phone completion with the new build remains unverified.

## Established Samsung evidence (owner report)

- Action #314: persistent-signing baseline, installed and launched.
- Action #318: installed over #314 without uninstall; launched successfully.
- Termux connection, RUN_COMMAND bootstrap, authenticated localhost bridge,
  command probing, and the Termux test button succeeded.
- MCP stdio reached Termux; stderr exposed the previous npx binary-resolution error.
- Owner screenshots from the session show packaged v332, connected Termux,
  Playwright with 25 verified tools, and Memory with 9 verified tools. Both MCPs
  are shown stopped, which is the expected state after enable-time verification.
  This supports successful managed installation and discovery on Samsung; it
  does not establish browser launch, Memory write/read, or reconnect acceptance.
- The browser conversation shows a `playwright.browser_tabs` invocation followed
  by provider rate limiting/cooldown. Its collapsed result does not prove a
  completed browser task.
- Optional external Android MCP fails loading `sharp` on android-arm64. Other
  screenshots show missing uvx/obu/server binaries and owner-side Google service
  setup. These are explicit dependency/configuration blockers, not evidence of
  a broken Termux connection.

## Current correction

The managed install's initial `test -f` legitimately exits 1 for a missing entry.
Bridge protocol v2 incorrectly returned `ok=false`, and the runtime raised
`BridgeError` before npm could run. Protocol v3 returns `ok=true` for handled
command outcomes, including nonzero exits and timeouts. Callers inspect `status`,
`exit_code`, `command_success`, `stdout`, and `stderr`. Authentication, invalid
requests, transport errors, and bridge-operation errors still raise. The existing
health/version check automatically replaces a running v2 bridge through RUN_COMMAND.

The installer accepts only completed exit 0 as an existing/verified entry,
completed exit 1 as a missing entry, and explicit exit 0 from npm setup. Missing
exit codes or timeouts cannot become success. No timeout values were increased.

A real npm installation exposed another pre-existing blocker: Memory and Filesystem
`0.6.3` do not exist in the npm registry. They now pin the nearest published version,
`0.6.2`; Playwright remains `0.0.83` and Android MCP remains `1.14.4`. Termux starts
npm bundles with `node` and their managed entry path, without runtime npx.
Filesystem remains intentionally unavailable for app-private projects.

Enabling still persists configuration only after real initialize,
notifications/initialized, and tools/list complete successfully.

## Host evidence and reproducible CI checks

- 49 focused runtime/bridge/MCP regression tests passed locally, including actual
  authenticated HTTP + shell nonzero-exit handling, initial missing-entry flow,
  retained auth/bridge failures, timeout results, and v2 replacement.
- `connectors/phase10_mcp_validation.py` installed the real pinned Memory and
  Playwright npm packages into fresh temporary directories and ran them through
  the actual HTTP bridge and direct-node stdio path on Linux.
- Memory: initialize + initialized + tools/list returned 9 tools; create_entities
  succeeded and read_graph retained its entity after stop/start.
- Playwright: initialize + initialized + tools/list returned 25 tools; stop/start
  rediscovered the tools. Browser launch was NOT tested by this host check.
- The Android workflow runs this integration script after its regression suite.
  Android discovery and HOME are substituted for this Linux harness; npm, HTTP,
  shell, JSON-RPC and MCP servers are real. This is NOT Samsung evidence.
- CI success, release signing verification, and artifact identity must be checked
  on the workflow run for the exact new commit before recommending its APK.

## Required Samsung evidence before closing Phase 10

Use only the successful persistent-signed build identified in the handoff. Install
over the existing app. All operations below use the app; no manual Termux commands
are required. Record the build number and exact UI result/error for each operation.

1. On the new build, ask the agent for a Memory and browser task. Confirm it uses
   `capability_ensure` where needed, starts the MCP and verifies live discovery.
   Initial v332 discovery is evidenced above; new automatic preparation and
   actual task completion still require phone results.
2. Run a real Memory write/read task and a Playwright browser task. Check results,
   then stop/start/reconnect each MCP and repeat. Playwright must actually launch
   Termux Chromium; discovery alone is insufficient browser acceptance.
3. Disconnect/reconnect during a real task. Confirm honest failure/pause state and
   successful recovery without duplicate or fabricated results.
4. Restart the app and then the phone. Check persisted configuration, correct live
   process state, Memory data, and successful MCP restart/reconnect.
5. Exercise a verified hot update and rollback on Samsung; record active revision
   before update, after update, and after rollback.
6. Run a long task; stop, resume from checkpoint, and exercise watchdog recovery.
   Verify durable checkpoint/state and absence of duplicate side effects.
7. Exercise crash/recovery; collect the app's crash report and verify restored task
   and MCP state. Final acceptance remains open until these results are recorded.

Samsung managed-install/discovery evidence is recorded above. Phase 10 remains
open for the remaining real task, restart, recovery and update acceptance.

## Automatic preparation, recovery and update changes

The agent now has tools for compatible bundled MCP preparation, packaged plugin
installation, evidence-backed project skill creation, and restricted HTTPS MCP
Registry discovery/installation. MCP configuration still requires successful
initialize/initialized/tools/list; first-install errors show `health_failed`.

Provider recovery retries only an uncommitted model request, respecting cooldown,
capabilities, Stop and a bounded budget. Downloaded, explicitly capable configured
local models can be tried as a last resort. Tests of this local fallback mock the
model runtime; no real GGUF inference is claimed. Unmet goals, exhausted step
budgets, breaker stops and failed verification remain resumable, not complete.

Successful persistent-signed Phase 10 CI builds publish immutable versioned engine
assets before updating the GitHub channel pointer. A packaged background worker
stages and verifies compatible updates, waits for idle and requests the existing
Android engine restart through the WebView. Native startup health/rollback remains
the final acceptance gate. Native APK changes still require Android confirmation.
See `MUSABAI_RUNTIME_AND_AI_ROUTER_FIX.md` for the plan comparison and limitations.

## uv/uvx automatic preparation correction

The owner rejected uv/uvx readiness after #337: that build only installed the
package on an agent request or MCP enable. A new engine-owned worker now checks
connected Termux at startup and after reconnection, installs the official `uv`
package when missing, and executes **both** version commands before reporting
ready. It does not require a model response or an open chat. Musab Hub shows
progress, verified version output, or the actual failure. Failures retry up to
three times; the existing Termux Test button permits another attempt. Engine
activation waits while this worker is installing, and shutdown cancels its job.

Host regression tests cover preparation, verification failure, bounded retries,
reconnection and update coordination; UI tests cover visible states. These are
not Samsung installation evidence. Device readiness remains pending until the
updated app displays verified uv and uvx versions. Python MCP compatibility and
initialize/tools/list acceptance remain separate requirements.

## Samsung screenshots: native dependency compatibility follow-up

The owner supplied screenshots showing Browser Use Python builds failing, Docling
rejecting Python 3.14 Torch wheels, Android MCP failing to load `sharp` for
android-arm64, Memory **running**, GitHub **connected**, Google services lacking
owner OAuth registration, and an unauthenticated external MCP error. These are
separate failures; they do not show a disconnected Termux bridge.

Browser Use, Docling and optional external Android MCP now use a dedicated managed
Debian bookworm container in Termux. Python 3.11 and Linux wheels replace Android
Python wheel resolution; pinned Linux Node 22.22.0 meets Android MCP/sharp engine
requirements. Installation finishes and imports are checked before MCP starts.
A real initialize/initialized/tools/list still gates persistence. Proot startup,
Android kernel compatibility, storage and real Samsung execution remain unproven.
This setup can download substantial packages and runs only when requested.

Live Linux host evidence: Browser Use 16 tools plus real Chromium navigation and
HTML read; Docling 21 tools plus a real cache-list call; Android MCP 76 tools with
real adb installed (no attached Android device controlled). CI runs these checks
before APK build. Host regression tests cover install failure, import verification,
retries, and update exclusion. Full bounded stderr and HTTP status diagnostics
replace truncated/generic errors. Registry installs can use an owner-entered bearer
token, saved only after verification in the existing private MCP configuration.

Open-browser-use still needs its browser extension on a supported desktop browser;
Android Chrome cannot load it. Filesystem MCP cannot read app-private project data
from Termux; existing native file tools cover that workspace. Google OAuth client
registration/API activation and user consent, service subscriptions and provider
keys cannot be fabricated. The Hub now explains these requirements and available
built-in alternatives rather than silently presenting broken installation buttons.
Phase 10 remains open for real-device acceptance; this is not an all-connected claim.

## Performance regression repair after the owner rejected #339

Source inspection and failing regression tests found redundant runtime discovery:
Hub catalog rendering resolved eight bundle runtimes independently; probes for a
new command replaced the cache for previous commands; Termux status queried the
entire account/OAuth catalog. A transient bridge health timeout also entered the
bridge restart path, risking live MCP stdio sessions under CPU load.

The repair batches catalog requirements into one request, retains command-specific
cache expiry, uses a native Termux-only status operation, and permits bootstrap
only for connection-refused or protocol-version mismatch. Timeouts and auth errors
are surfaced without restarting the bridge. Hidden UI polling stops. Expensive
update verification waits for active conversations/installations to finish;
Linux and uv preparation share the package-install lock and source-build parallelism
is bounded. Host behavioral tests reproduce the original failures and verify the
repair. Samsung responsiveness is not claimed without new device evidence.

This revision changes the Android host: install its persistent-signed APK. The
native-fingerprint check correctly prevents an older APK from applying this engine
alone. Existing account grants and project data are not cleared by these changes.

## Missing tool arguments in the calculator / command screenshots

The new Samsung screenshots show `write` missing `content` and `runtime_exec` /
`bash` missing `command`. They do not include the raw provider stream, so the exact
on-device trigger is not established. Host regressions reproduced argument loss:
an unindexed continuation became another call, repeated names were concatenated,
and final message snapshots or object arguments corrupted the assembled call.
The stream assembler now tracks call IDs and indexes, keeps actual argument text,
and rejects ambiguous identities instead of guessing. Only the first completion
choice is consumed. Canonical arguments take precedence over aliases.

Preflight now validates required arguments before permissions and side effects,
accepts unambiguous argument wrappers, and returns the required schema for repair.
A null `write.content` is rejected before opening a file; intentional empty strings
remain valid. A full agent-loop HTTP/SSE regression verifies incomplete-call
feedback followed by a corrected call and a real file write. Repetition remains
bounded by the existing circuit breaker. Packaged prompt v8 refreshes built-in
prompts in old conversations with the required argument contract.

Live host evidence: the free `stepfun/step-3.7-flash:free` provider supplied both
`path` and `content` for a write request, and supplied a complete `bash.command`;
the latter executed in the host shell with exit 0 and the expected marker. These
are live provider/host results, not Samsung acceptance. No device result or
all-connected claim is inferred. New regressions are in CI and the trusted engine
validation suite. Phase 10 remains open pending device acceptance.

## Application-wide reliability and workspace improvements after #343

The owner requested broader development within Phase 10. Reproduced host failures
included cross-conversation checkpoint selection, lost verified progress after
Stop, shell exit 1 recorded as completed, unobserved streaming progress, and two
concurrent MCP starts creating duplicate processes. HTTP provider errors also
lost `Retry-After` headers before the router received them. A failing extension
catalog prevented the entire Hub refresh, and operation feedback was separated
from the selected card.

The new changes preserve and resume the same task/objective within its owning
conversation, keep verified work when stopped, distinguish failed/pending tool
outcomes, and observe terminal/tool-argument streaming without writing every
fragment to disk. An authenticated, bounded task-state view supplies a new Tasks
tab with saved progress, blockers and a continuation draft; it does not silently
send a new task or claim background execution.

MCP lifecycle requests serialize per project/bundle, remain cancellable while
waiting, and defer automatic engine activation while an operation is active.
Disabling automatic updates pauses automatically queued activation; an explicitly
requested activation remains available. Provider cooldown honors real response
headers, rejects nonfinite retry values, tracks partial streams even without a UI
callback, and exposes sanitized health in the provider cards. Saving a replacement
key clears only that provider's old failure state; a saved key is not verification.

Hub sections refresh independently and retain operation feedback beside each
card. Provider refresh preserves unsaved key drafts in the current page only.
Regression tests cover these failures, session isolation, concurrent starts,
cancellation, real HTTP Retry-After, provider status, update exclusion, and the
new workspace workflow. Full regression, UI, signing and original-engine checks
are required before publishing. These are host/CI improvements, not new Samsung
acceptance; Phase 10 remains open for the previously listed device checks.

## Interrupted provider streams after #345

Samsung screenshot 95182 reports `Upstream idle timeout exceeded`, including a
failure after partial reasoning. The router previously refused failover after
any streamed event, even though that model request had not returned a completion
or executed a tool. A statusless idle-timeout error before output also retried
the same slow provider. In-band SSE errors lost their status/retry metadata, and
an EOF without a completion marker could return unfinished tool calls.

The agent now explicitly opts into bounded recovery at the model-request
boundary. It clears only the failed response draft, preserves completed tool
messages and checkpoints, and lets the health-aware pool choose an available
free model. Callers without a draft-reset callback keep the no-replay contract.
User Stop interrupts recovery. Raw provider causes remain in diagnostics; an
exhausted recovery reports the interruption and saved progress in Arabic.
Timeouts switch routes without retrying the same request first. Both OpenAI and
Anthropic streams require a completion signal before returning tool calls;
in-band errors preserve HTTP-like status and retry metadata.

Regression evidence uses real local HTTP/SSE servers: one write completes, the
next response streams reasoning/text/tool arguments and fails with the exact
reported timeout, then a replacement provider writes the requested file. The
first write is not replayed and the interrupted write never executes. Other
checks cover bounded retries, Stop, missing completion markers, error metadata,
and removal of only uncommitted UI nodes. No new Samsung acceptance is inferred.

## Device rejection of #346: large context and malformed model calls

The user explicitly confirmed screenshots 95201/95203/95193/95212/95293 were
from #346. They show recurrent failed recovery with roughly 100k–132k input
tokens, `write` missing `content`, and `bash` missing `command`. #346 is not
accepted as resolving these device failures.

The next revision adds non-destructive remote request projection. Older completed
tool-call/result groups become clearly labeled historical records containing
paths, payload hashes and actual result excerpts. Old OpenAI reasoning is not
resent. System/user instructions, images and incomplete tool groups remain
intact; full local session history and files are not changed. The working budget
is 96k characters including schema allowance, not a token guarantee; protected
instructions can exceed it. Native/local model history stays unchanged.

Remote agent completions are validated as a whole before any tool executes.
Missing/invalid required fields or unsupported tool names are model failures,
not successful provider replies. The failing route enters a cooldown and the
uncommitted response can move to another available free model. Existing supported
tool aliases/JSON syntax repair are retained; explicitly truncated values are
rejected. Built-in prompt v9 asks for small complete edits and runnable increments.

Host HTTP/SSE regressions cover a valid write paired with an invalid bash call:
neither call from that batch executes, the existing file stays unchanged, and a
replacement response writes the intended result. Large-history tests verify that
instructions and tool/result pairing survive and the original history is intact.
An initial live NVIDIA attempt returned a real 503 overload; that is not a pass.
A subsequent live free-pool probe using high reasoning selected
`stepfun/step-5-preview-free`: 934,492 historical characters became 86,612 outgoing
characters, the API reported 12,321 input tokens, and a complete validated write
executed once. The initial invalid response was controlled; the fallback API was
live. This does not prove the new revision on Samsung or eliminate provider outages.
